trigger:
- master

#pool:
# vmImage: ubuntu-latest

#variables:
#  buildConfiguration: 'Release'

# This example runs three stages, one after another. The middle stage runs two jobs in parallel. 

# stages:
# - stage: Build
#   jobs:
#   - job: BuildJob
#     steps:
#     - script: echo Building!
# - stage: Test
#   jobs:
#   - job: TestOnWindows
#     steps:
#     - script: echo Testing on Windows!
#   - job: TestOnLinux
#     steps:
#     - script: echo Testing on Linux!
# - stage: Deploy
#   jobs:
#   - job: Deploy
#     steps:
#     - script: echo Deploying the code!

# This example runs two stages in parallel. For brevity, the jobs and steps are omitted.
